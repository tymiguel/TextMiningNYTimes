# TextMiningNYTimes

The New York Times (sometimes abbreviated NYT and The Times) is an American daily newspaper, founded and continuously published in New York City since September 18, 1851, by The New York Times Company. The New York Times has won 119 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other newspaper. The paper's print version in 2013 had the second-largest circulation, behind The Wall Street Journal, and the largest circulation among the metropolitan newspapers in the US. The New York Times is ranked 18th in the world by circulation.

The Times exposes APIs (application programming interfaces) for noncommercial use allowing developer community to programmatically access New York Times data for use in different applications. Using The Times Article Search API, we can search New York Times articles from September 18, 1851 to today, retrieving headlines, abstracts, lead paragraphs, links to associated multimedia, and other article metadata.

In this report, we leverage The Times Article Search API to search and retrieve news articles based on a unique query term to showcase nuances of text mining techniques in conjunction with R programming language for data scientists. Specifically, we categorize the retrieved article content into distinct clusters to discover the underlying topics per cluster. For the purpose of this report, we focus our analysis to articles containing the word "drone" and published between June 1, 2016 and March 25, 2017.
